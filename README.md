# Eulogio's Blog

Laravel-based blog using Angularjs, built following <a href="scotch.io/tutorials/php/create-a-laravel-and-angular-single-page-comment-application">Chris Sevilleja's excellent tutorial</a>.  I plan on using this for my own personal projects.                                                                      
## TODO:
